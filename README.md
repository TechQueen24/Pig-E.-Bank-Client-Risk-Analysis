# Pig-E.-Bank-Client-Risk-Analysis
## Project Summary
To increase customer retention, Pig E's sales team wants to identify the leading indicators that a customer will leave the bank. I’ve created a table of client attributes that I believe could indicate whether client will leave—for example, age, estimated salary, etc.  The goal of this project is to use this information to identify the top risk factors that contribute to client loss and model them in a decision tree. 
## Key Questions
* What are the top 3 factors that causes a client to leave Pig E bank?
## Systems Used
* **Microsoft Excel:** For cleaning and organizing raw data.
* **Microsoft PowerPoint:** For visualizing data.
## Data Overview
Dataset includes customer_ID, last_name (client), credit score, country, gender, age, tenure, account balance, number of products, credit card acquisition, membership info, estimated salary, and exited from bank.
